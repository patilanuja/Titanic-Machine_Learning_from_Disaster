# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my code for predicting whether or not a passenger on the Titanic survived using support vector machines (SVMs).

The Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster Kaggle competition challenges participants to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic. The competition dataset contains information about the passengers of the Titanic, including their gender, age, class, and whether or not they survived.

In this project, I used SVMs to predict survival. SVMs are a discriminative machine learning model that predicts a target variable by finding a hyperplane that separates the two classes of data. SVMs are often used for classification problems, such as predicting whether or not a passenger survived the Titanic sinking. 

I evaluated my model on the test set using accuracy. My model achieved an accuracy of 68% on the test set.
